# Autonomous driving semantic segmentation improvement using generalized divisive normalization

The main objective is to check if the segmentation of autonomous driving images is improved by applying the technique known as generalized divisive normalization.

## Dataset: Cistyscapes

Large-scale dataset that contains a diverse set of stereo video sequences recorded in street scenes from 50 different cities, with high quality pixel-level annotations of 5000 frames in addition to a larger set of 20000 weakly annotated frames. You can access it from [here](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/).
